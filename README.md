# Unity Augmented Reality (AR) Toolkit

This repository tests the vuforia augmented reality SDK with Unity. I configured a simple scene from my favorite groups of musics. Representing by animals. The project would detect the image target and display a 3D model of the corresponding animal along with playing a music track.

See the link to youtube below for a demo of the project in action:
